Hi!

Welcome to the blog. So stoked you made it here. This blog is a place for me to record some of the many things I learn on my way to becoming a planetary software developer (whatever that means).

The most recent thing that I've learned is...

## How to assemble a simple blog using GitHub Pages and Jekyll

If you are also interested in starting a blog for free with Jekyll and GitHub Pages, check out this great, [comprehensive guide by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

If you want to use this snazzy Jekyll theme, Pixyll, check out the [Github repository](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) to download it.

Or, if you'd rather browse for a blog theme that is more your style, see [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/).

## Thanks!

If you're not here to make a blog, thanks for being here anyways! Expect to see more software development, planetary science and/or data sciecne content soon!
