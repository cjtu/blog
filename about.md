This blog is written by me, Christian.

I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with an Hon. BSc. in Planetary Science and Physics. My undergraduate research in lunar data science inspired me to try my hand at software development. I am currently working as a software developer intern at a small startup in Toronto. All thoughts and views shared here are my own! Unless I get h@ck -- ErR0R --

I don't really know what a planetary developer is, but that's half the fun. Maybe when I do know I'll be able to drop the *becoming*. This blog was born out of a need to learn some web development (forking a template on GitHub counts as learning right?) and to have a place to spew some of the many things I learn weekly so that I can refer to them later. If they help anyone that comes after me, then that's great too.
